This visor is intended to be produced from 0.5mm PETG film. In situations where PETG is not available, PET film can be substituted when sufficient surface quality and optical clarity can be guaranteed.

With sufficient laser power and optimization, one visor can be cut in one minute.

For flat PETG sheets coated with protective film, cutting in two passes is recommended using the highest speed and lowest power settings possible. We are currently cutting in two passes on a 120W Epilog CO2 system at 100s/70p/50f with power compensation enabled.

For PET material from the roll, cutting in a single pass using the provided templates marked 'with BRIDGES' will ensure correct registration of the work pieces. Since this material generally is not coated with protective film, it is recommended to remove cutting residue using alcohol.

On a low-cost 40W Lasercutter (tested on Beambox Pro) we have achieved good results with uncoated PET from a roll, cutting in a single pass at 30mm/sec and 63% Power.

When laser cutting PETG or PET, a sufficient exhaust extractor and filter system is necessary.

Preliminary tests indicate that PETG is resistant to disinfection agents including isopropyl alcohol, quaternary ammonium compounds and hydrogen peroxide solution. Note: PET/PETG components are *not* dishwasher safe.

We strongly urge everyone to adhere to the strictest hygiene measures and to consult with local authorities before beginning production or distribution.
