This visor is intended to be produced from 0.5mm PETG film. In situations where PETG is not available, PET film can be substituted when sufficient surface quality and optical clarity can be guaranteed.

For flat PETG sheets, cutting in two passes is recommended using the highest speed and lowest power settings possible.
We are currently cutting in two passes on a 120W Epilog CO2 system at 100s/70p/50f with power compensation enabled.

For PET material from the roll, cutting in a single pass using the provided templates marked 'with BRIDGES' will ensure correct registration of the work pieces.  

When working with PETG or PET, a sufficient exhaust extractor and filter system is necessary.

Preliminary tests indicate that PETG is resistant to disinfection agents including isopropyl alcohol, quaternary ammonium compounds and hydrogen peroxide solution. Note: PET/PETG components are *not* dishwasher safe.

We strongly urge everyone to adhere to the strictest hygiene measures and to consult with local authorities before beginning production or distribution. 

While this design is being shared in good faith, the Bahaus Form + Function Lab and Bauhaus-Universität Weimar do not guarantee the suitability for use, merchantability, or fitness for particular purpose of the this visor, and do not assume liability arising from their production or use.
