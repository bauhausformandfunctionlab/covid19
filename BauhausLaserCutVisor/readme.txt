Project Files for the Bauhaus Laser Cut Visor.

This Visor is intended to be produced from 0.5mm PETG film.
Cutting in two passes is recommended using the highest speed and lowest power settings possible.
We are currently cutting on a 120W Epilog CO2 system at 100s/70p/50f with power compensation enabled.
