**Project Files for the Bauhaus Laser Cut Visor**<br />
Co-developed by Prof. Andreas Mühlenberend & Vertr.-Prof. Jason Reizner<br />
Bauhaus-Universität Weimar

This visor is intended to be produced from 0.5mm PETG film.
Cutting in two passes is recommended using the highest speed and lowest power settings possible.
We are currently cutting in two passes on a 120W Epilog CO2 system at 100s/70p/50f with power compensation enabled.
When working with PETG, a sufficient exhaust extractor and filter system is necessary.

We strongly urge everyone to adhere to the strictest hygiene measures and to consult with local authorities before beginning production or distribution. 

While this design is being shared in good faith, the Bahaus Form + Function Lab and Bauhaus-Universität Weimar do not guarantee the suitability for use, merchantability, or fitness for particular purpose of the this visor, and do not assume liability arising from their production or use.
